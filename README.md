## Motivation

There does not exist a free, open and powerful tool for colleges (specifically higher educational institutes) to enhance and improve processes through the effective management of data. The project aims to provide RESTful API services alone.

> Check out [School Tool](https://launchpad.net/schooltool) and see if it meets our needs.
